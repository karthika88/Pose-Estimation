# Pose-Estimation
Extracting Pose Data Patterns From Pre-Recorded Video Footage


In many applications, including measuring physical activity, understanding sign language, and controlling full-body gestures, human position estimation from video is essential. A machine learning (ML) method called MediaPipe Posture uses RGB video frames to infer 33 3D landmarks and a background segmentation mask on the entire body for high-fidelity body pose tracking.

Here the pose estimation and counting of hand shaking task was done by only consider the necessary landmarks of wrist and elbow. Variation of x, y ccordinates of the wrist with respect to the elbow.
